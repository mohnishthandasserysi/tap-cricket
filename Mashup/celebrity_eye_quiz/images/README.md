## Supported Formats

- `.jpg`

## Requirements

- At least 4 images are needed to play the quiz
- Images should clearly show the person's face
- Higher quality images work better for face detection

## Notes

- The file name (without extension) will be used as the celebrity's name in the quiz
- Use underscores for spaces in names (e.g., `shah_rukh.jpg` will display as "Shah Rukh")
- Make sure faces are clearly visible and not too small in the image
