# Celebrity Images

Place celebrity images in this folder with the following filenames:

- `leonardo-dicaprio.jpg`
- `emma-watson.jpg`
- `ryan-reynolds.jpg`
- `scarlett-johansson.jpg`
- `chris-hemsworth.jpg`
- `jennifer-lawrence.jpg`

## Image Requirements:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Size: At least 400x400 pixels for best face detection results
- Clear frontal face view with good lighting
- Single person in the image (for better face detection accuracy)

## Where to find images:
- Use high-quality publicity photos or professional headshots
- Ensure images are copyright-free or properly licensed
- Good sources: Wikimedia Commons, official social media profiles, or stock photo sites

## Note:
The game uses face-api.js to detect facial landmarks and crop the eye region. Clear, well-lit photos with unobstructed faces will work best for the game mechanics.
