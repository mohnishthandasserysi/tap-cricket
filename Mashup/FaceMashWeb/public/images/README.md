# Players Folder

This folder should contain celebrity/player images for the Face Mashup Game.

## File Naming Convention

Each image file should be named after the player/celebrity:
- `cristiano_ronaldo.jpg` (for Cristiano Ronaldo)
- `lionel_messi.jpg` (for Lionel Messi)
- `neymar.jpg` (for Neymar Jr.)
- `kylian_mbappe.jpg` (for Kylian Mbappé)
- `mohamed_salah.jpg` (for Mohamed Salah)
- `harry_kane.jpg` (for Harry Kane)
- `kevin_de_bruyne.jpg` (for Kevin De Bruyne)
- `robert_lewandowski.jpg` (for Robert Lewandowski)

## Supported Formats

- `.jpg`
- `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.bmp`

## Image Requirements

- **Face Visibility**: Images should clearly show the person's face
- **Resolution**: Higher resolution images (at least 512x512) work better
- **Angle**: Front-facing or slightly angled faces work best
- **Lighting**: Well-lit images produce better results
- **Background**: Any background is fine, the algorithm will focus on the face

## Minimum Requirements

- **At least 3 images** are needed to play the game
- **At least 5-6 images** recommended for better gameplay variety

## Notes

- The file name (without extension) will be used as the player's name in the game
- Use underscores for spaces in names (e.g., `cristiano_ronaldo.jpg` will display as "Cristiano Ronaldo")
- Make sure faces are clearly visible and not too small in the image
- The game will automatically detect faces and extract features like eyes, nose, and mouth
